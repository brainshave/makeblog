# Makeblog â€” The Advertising

Makeblog is yet-simple and **fast** static site generator.

Features:

1. Markdown for content source.
2. Mustache for layouts.
3. Make for recreating only what really changed.
4. Fast: works well with multiple make jobs (`make -jX`).
5. Fast, p.2: uses node.js for scripts.
6. Generated and static files lives in one directory.

# Flow

Here is how it works:

1. `src/*.md` files are parsed to `tmp/*.json` files (HTML with some metadata).
2. `tmp/*.index.json` files are generated for main list and each tag.
3. `tmp/*.<layout-name>.json` files are parsed using layouts from `layouts` directory to files in main site's directory with suffixes dependent on suffix in layouts name. If layouts have versions with different suffixes, Each input file will be generated in both versions.
